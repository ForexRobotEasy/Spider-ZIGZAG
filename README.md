**Code Description:**

The 'Spider ZIGZAG' code is an expert advisor (EA) that uses the Zigzag indicator to predict peak market activity in the Forex market. The code is written in MQL5 and can be used on MetaTrader 5 platform.

The code consists of the following sections:

1. Include files: The necessary include file 'Trade.mqh' is included to handle trading operations.

2. Global variables: The global variable 'trade' is defined to initialize the trade module.

3. Expert initialization function: The 'OnInit()' function is called when the expert advisor is initialized. It initializes the trade module and any other necessary code can be added here.

4. Expert deinitialization function: The 'OnDeinit()' function is called when the expert advisor is deinitialized. It cleans up the trade module and any necessary cleanup code can be added here.

5. Expert tick function: The 'OnTick()' function is called on every tick of the market. It performs the main logic of the expert advisor. It fetches the forex market data, spreads zigzag lines between peaks, determines the significance of peak market activity, identifies correction periods, detects trend reversals, displays the market data and predictions, and executes trades based on the predictions.

6. Helper functions: Several helper functions are defined to perform specific tasks. These functions include 'GetMarketData()' to fetch forex market data, 'SpreadZigzagLines()' to calculate and return zigzag lines, 'DeterminePeakActivity()' to determine the significance of peak market activity, 'IdentifyCorrectionPeriod()' to identify the convergence of 3-4 zigzag lines at a peak, 'DetectTrendReversal()' to detect the convergence of 5-6 zigzag lines at a peak, 'DisplayData()' to display the market data and predictions, and 'ExecuteTrades()' to execute trades based on the predictions.
